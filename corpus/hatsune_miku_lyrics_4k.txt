What a sad colour the world can be, my friend.
What a grim face you can put on, oh my friend.
 
One story ended, and it left you blank.
You fell your face, as flowers are limp in a vase.
You have changed after the end of a dream.
I see a fire in your heart now gone out.
 
Look up to the sky.
The sunlight will revive your spirits.
 
Open your arms.
Breathe in the fresh air, feeling the wind.
Rest yourself for a next dream.
 
You said the world looked monotonous,
As if you were dumped off in no where.
So I sing to you.
 
Listen to me well,
It's not a white lie, that
All the darkness you see
Are mere a facet of the life.
 
Because this world is so full of brightness,
Soon you will find your way, and the colour of the world will be back.
 
Doo la la la
Doo la doo doo
 
Even if we were having rotten luck,
Even if we were in hard weather,
We could get through it.
Oh, tu tu tu tu tu
 
La la la..
We dream a dream, after the end of a dream.
 
La la la..
We dream a dream, after the end of a dream.

When I need motivation my one solution is my queen
Cause she stays strong, yeah yeah
She is always in my car right there when I want her
Oh, all these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really
 
Cause oh I think, that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
 
She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah
Cause I'm the wizard of love and I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting but I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really
 
Cause oh I think, that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
 
She gives me love and effection
Baby did I mention you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too she thinks I made the right selection
Now all thats left to do is just for me to pop the question
 
Cause oh I think, that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her
Oh, I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She's always right there when I need her. I need Her.

There is something in this world that everybody's searching for...
Have you seen the signs that are sent by the universe?
Sometimes they are hidden and hard to find...
Would you like to come with me?
 
We go on a journey and I show you
the world of coming together
coming together
Ooh...
Ooh...

There was a star many light years away.
 
Dreaming one day she’d be given a name
 
shining alone she could never persuade
their eyes to look up at her rays.
 
One day a comet passed by her way.
 
He said “my dear, wipe those tears from your face.
 
The light of one it will never replace
a thousand brilliant suns in place.”
 
For when our paths align
patterns in the sky
lighting up the night
Constellation
 
Followed the signs, footprints leading the way
 
Until she found other stars out in space.
 
They locked their arms and together they framed
a constellation bright as day.
 
For when our paths align
patterns in the sky
lighting up the night.
Constellation
 
Open your eyes and tell me what do you see?
 
The galaxy is staring back at me.
 
These random dots are dancing in sync
inside you and me.
 
Open your eyes.
Open your eyes.
Tell me what do you see?

When I came to you
You said it was true
It took my courage to
say that I really love you
 
So take my hand,
lets go far away
We will see
our new life today

The blue takes me faraway from the memories
That never fade away
With the helpless but flawless melodies
I am the one to take starlight alive
You think you have to survive
Look into my eyes and you know
meaningless Dawning Blue
 
Breathing lets me ignorant
Shine___Like tears
All lies are discrepant
 
The gleam of dawn lasts forever without mercy
’Til the end of the night
With the sleepless but timeless fantasy
I am the one to pray for all you pray
Don't think 'bout what someone say
Just love anything and you see
Limitless Dawning Blue
Motionless Dawning Blue
 
Breathing lets me ignorant
Shine___Like tears
All lies are discrepant
 
Heaven knows I've felt lonely
But you’re my one and only
So I just want you to know
How Dawning Blue’s gonna glow
No way to deny nothing
Wish I would be just laughing
Even though that will not come true
I sing to find something new
Turning on a crystal set
I can’t help but feel regrets
In my sight are satellites
That keep me awake tonight
Give me, Give me Dawning Blue
Show me, Show me Dawning Blue
The star colored Dawning Blue
The sky colored Dawning Blue

I look in my looking glass and I see
A man's reflection who said, he loved me
Blinded by love, I just couldn't see
That our love was never meant to last
Don't go away
 
I take his hand with his touching me
We hold each other, so tenderly
And we kiss, our last
And think of, what we've passed
A love that didn't last
Don't go away
 
And as I watch, we are further apart
But there's still a flame, so deep in my heart
I shed a tear as I see you go
And as forever, I will love you so
Don't go away

Get down and spin a bit around
You'll never know when the dance floor'd stop lighting
Turn to the stars and get to flyin'
above you, Wait, what should you do?
 
Will you want give in and dance to the groove or get to the sky?
Well, I'm sure you can do the two
Lift your hands up, party, and the world will watch you move
There is just nobody that could stop your party
 
Lights
Turn up the heat, Let's fill up the streets, We follow your beat, You shan't feel defeated
Rise
Listen to me, It's time to believe, you have your own beat, you take your own seat and-
As the scene gets too close to the bitter end.
open the lights, put a smile and it will start again
you take control of your life, life belongs to you
 
Feel Alive
Go Chase, the wind wants to race
Not everything int he world wants to block you
listen closely and you'll hear them sing
just for you, And what will you do?
Will you dance with the wind, give in to the groove or ride it and fly?
 
Well, I'm sure you can do the two
Lift your hands up, party, and the world will watch you move
There is just nobody that could stop your party
 
Lights
Turn up the heat, Let's fill up the streets, We follow your beat, You shan't feel defeated
Rise
Listen to me, It's time to believe, you have your own beat, you take your own seat and-
Take the path with the least frowns along the way
And though your last, just choose for you and it's okay
 
You take control of your life, life belongs to you
Feel Alive
 
When you're stuck in a storm and wonder why
try to find a mountain and begin to climb
Don't you ever quit,ride along with it
(yeah!)
 
And with the thunder
you should scream out loud
Let your growls and the lightning make your disco ground
 
When I see your smile it's electrifying!
Cause nothing can stop your party rockin'
 
Lights
Turn up the heat,Move with your feet.We follow your beat,You shan't feel defeated
Rise
Listen to me,It's time to believe,You follow your beat,You take your own seat and-
As the scene gets to close to the bitter end
Open the lights,put a smile and it will start again

Feel Alive
Take the path with the least frowns along the way
And though your last,just choose for you and it's okay
You take control of your life,life belongs to you

When I was little
I was taught that the world wasn't my story
All the tears I will cry
Wouldn't even make up a sea
 
Tell me how I'll be found
Let it be known
Tell me who will become still
When I am shown
 
And I'll be forgotten in time
no matter how hard I try
I'll be a wasted life
So this is my goodbye
Wake me when I
have the courage to die
Cause I'm too scared to try
I am a wasted life
So this is my goodbye
 
I never wanted fame
Cause when we are dead it's all the same
Human mortality is a test on our memory
 
Let me know when I'll go
Will I be loved
Will someone care I'm not there
Am I enough
 
And I'll be forgotten in time
no matter how hard I try
I'll be a wasted life
So this is my goodbye
Wake me when I
have the courage to die
Cause I'm too scared to try
I am a wasted life
So this is my goodbye
 
So this is my goodbye
 
I'll stop hoping stop wishing
stop singing stop living
Stop, I'll stop
 
I'll stop moving stop breathing
Stop thinking stop living
Stop, Just stop
 
And I'll be forgotten in time
no matter how hard I try
I'll be a wasted life
So this is my goodbye
Wake me when I
have the courage to die
Cause I'm too scared to try
I am a wasted life
So this is my goodbye

Even from here on, playing with everyone
We've been talking with each other while laughing but
I really know, and understand that
Spending our time together like this, won't happen again
 
I won't forget the scenery at the hill road we walked on for many times
 
If the spring comes, this road too will surely
Have petals fluttering and dancing around
When that time comes, who are we with and where?
Even if we get separated, the time we spent together will stay
So let's lightly wave our hands at each other, say goodbye with a smile
 
Making new friends, buddies, and the like
We can increase the variety like this
 
Now, even the really old uniform that I hate
I seem to hold it dear
 
If the spring comes, from that surely
Little by little, we won't meet each other
Even it's like that, we should get used to it, right?
There's no way I wanted it to be over but, it's really going to be sad
That's why, in the end, let's wave our hands, say goodbye with a smile
 
Even now when the spring came, I can recall, the time of our old selves
The stairs to adulthood, we totally didn't see it
Now that we are separated, I wonder how everyone is doing
If we'll have the chance someday, we'll meet each other again smiling
 
If that happens, it will be great!

Once
when I
was small
 
You splattered paint on walls
somewhere deep inside my heart
but now, it fell apart
 
Let
the sky, turn dark
Leave shadows in the storms
I'll hold your hand on my own
For you, and all my hopes
 
Can I still survive?
When you’re not in my life
So I'm begging you please, I need
Your true self with me
 
My wish froze up with silence
waiting for you, to call my name
 
I'd want you here beside me
but from then on, you never were the same
 
Now our love's an illusion,
left to the night, what do I do?
 
Come please, hurry and save me
Give me a chance, to finally find you
 
Once
I saw
your eyes
 
a new world came to light
no more of all of these lies
it’s time, we start anew
 
Let,
our search,
unfold
the joys the world concealed
the truths we all want to feel
hidden, by illusion
 
Can I still survive?
When you’re not in my life
So I'm begging you please, I need
Your true self with me
 
My wish froze up with silence
waiting for you, to call my name
 
I'd want you here beside me
but from then on, you never were the same
 
Now our love's an illusion,
left to the night, what do I do?
 
Come please, hurry and save me
Give me a chance, to finally find you
 
My wish froze up with silence
waiting for you, to call my name
 
I'd want you here beside me
but from then on, you never were the same
 
Now our love's an illusion,
left to the night, what do I do?
 
Come please, hurry and save me
Give me a chance, to finally find you

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

I am hopeless
Thrashing and crashing down
Screaming silence
Letting out no sound
Spilling my guts
Over and over again
I can feel solace sinking in
 
Here we go
 
I've cried, I've hoped, I've lied
The story's always the same
I am not okay, no way
So take me up higher
Become fire
Erase the pain that I know
Make me feel like I can start to let go
 
I was crushed
Broken into pieces
When the echos of
Ten Thousand others just like me
lit up my sky
 
We are shining brighter and brighter
Pushing onward farther and farther
Shout out as one
Resound, and we will keep on
Fighting harder and harder
Hear us singing louder and louder
"We are not alone" in unison
 
I am obsolete, incomplete, a pity
Tears streaming, overflowing me
We will never be lonely
I am broken down, falling out, spinning 'round
A monster holding out to be
Together, together and free
 
Switch my heart inside out
I'm intergalactic now
Turn to the sky soaring
We are shining
We are..
 
We are shining brighter and brighter
Pushing onward farther and farther
Shout out as one
Resound, and we will keep on
Fighting harder and harder
Hear us singing louder and louder
"We are not alone" in unison
 
I am obsolete, incomplete, a pity
Tears streaming, overflowing me
We will never be lonely
I am broken down, falling out, spinning 'round
A monster holding out to be
Together, together and free

Put on a mask and don a false identity
I'm broken down into my core
Blood dripping, head is splitting,
Words are falling free
I can't take anymore
 
One by one it's over, this silence can't get louder
Bolt my jaw shut and throw away, away, away the key
Just one second longer,
A speed run to game over
I am a fatality
 
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than the stars
 
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity
Come on, Come and be free
Come on, Come and see
 
I'll cross my heart and swear I'll never be like that
With the tears seeping through the laughs
Blood dripping, guts are spilling
old fears come for me
How long can I last?
 
One by one it's over, this screaming can't get louder
Bolt my jaw shut and throw away, away, away the key
Just one second longer, A speed run to game over
I'm praying for serenity
 
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than the stars
 
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity
Come on, Come and be free
Come on, Come and see
 
Eternal, I'll become
Infernal, this feeling's
Eternal, I'll become
Infernal, I've become
 
I'm holding onto, onto, onto nothing
I've begun crashing, crashing, crashing hard
Let me feel panic, panic, panic again
Set ablaze, I'll shine brighter than the stars
 
and I'll finally see ten-thousand others just like me
Filling up the night sky, we'll never be lonely
Take me up where I can feel the zero gravity
Come on, Come and be free
Come on, Come and see
 
Make it a secret, Think you can keep it?
I'm not okay and I'll never be the same
Let's make a surprise, Set a date and time
Don't let them know
I won't say goodbye before I go

Went out with some friends of mine
That use to play the game
We lost and so predictably
They said I was to blame
They said I didn't care for them
Cared only for myself
And so without a second thought
I put them on the shelf, on the shelf
 
There was a boy that I once knew
He use to hang around
He dropped by the other day
He said I let him down
He told me that I used him
Just to get my way
And so without another word
I made him go away, go away
 
Thinking 'bout my life today
From whence and where it came
And so characteristically
I hold myself to blame
I wonder where I'll lead myself
And if I'll ever change
I guess it's really up to me
And that's what's really strange, really strange
 
Now I don't think it's tragic
And I won't take the blame
So I don't feel any pain at all

What are these lights,
dancing around
like they're celebrating?
 
What is that sound?
Is it a song,
do you hear it ringing?
 
You would think that there are angels
their voices above reaching all around the world
but it's just me stuck in the moment, stuck in time,
tik tok tik tok
 
It's amazing
to be here today
But what thrills me in this very moment in time
with you, with you
 
Just imagine
only you and me
and the world around is simply covered in white
subdued, subdued
 
What is that smile?
Is it meant for me
or am I just dreaming?
 
Look at those eyes,
Looking alive,
I can see them gleaming
 
You would think flowers are blooming
filling the earth in colors of different hues
but it's just me stuck in the moment, stuck in time
tiktok
 
What's this feeling
when I am with you?
Every second I can feel my heart going wild,
for you, for you
 
Please remember
as I sing this song
that I'm here, and the feelings I show are all mine
so true, so true
 
It's amazing
to be here today
But what thrills me in this very moment in time
with you, with you
 
Just imagine
only you and me
and the world around is simply covered in white
subdued, subdued
 
yeahhhh!

I walk alone thousand miles but I never got anything, No way.
I know that it is useless time, so I'm fine.
I'm singing, I'm seeing, I thinking but I confusing.
I wan't to be better than anymore.
 
Yeah!
 
I could be wrong I'm a stupid there are friends around me.
So I will back them again.
I understood I'm a stupid there is not right a way.
So I am walking ALONE!!!
